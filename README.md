# My freeCodeCamp Projects
Assets for my freeCodeCamp certification projects.
I take these courses to hone my current skills, expand my skillset, learn new skills, and explore new methods, technology and ways of thinking. I enjoy challenging myself in these ways.

## Responsive Web Design Projects
These projects demonstrate simple, but responsive, single-page websites. The freeCodeCamp test suite is included in most projects to determine if the project passed the requirements (user stories).
