# My freeCodeCamp Projects
Assets for my freeCodeCamp certification projects.
I take these courses to hone my current skills, expand my skillset, learn new skills, and explore new methods, technology and ways of thinking. I enjoy challenging myself in these ways.

## Responsive Web Design Projects
These projects demonstrate simple, but responsive, single-page websites. The freeCodeCamp test suite is included in most projects to determine if the project passed the requirements (user stories).
More details about each project are located in the root folder's [readme.md](Responsive%20Web%20Design%20Projects#responsive-web-design-projects) file.
