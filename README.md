# My freeCodeCamp Projects
Assets for my freeCodeCamp certification projects.
I take these courses to hone my current skills, expand my skillset, learn new skills, and explore new methods, technology and ways of thinking. I enjoy challenging myself in these ways.

## Responsive Web Design Projects
These projects demonstrate simple, but responsive, single-page websites. The freeCodeCamp test suite is included in most projects to determine if the project passed the requirements (user stories).
### Build a Tribute Page
**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).
The app must also pass the outlined [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). The test suite, if attached, checks for these to determine pass or fail.
