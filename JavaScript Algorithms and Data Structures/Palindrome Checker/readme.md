# Palindrome Checker
Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A _palindrome_ is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
**Note:** You'll need to remove **all non-alphanumeric characters** (punctuation, spaces, and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
We'll pass strings with various formats and with special characters to test.
