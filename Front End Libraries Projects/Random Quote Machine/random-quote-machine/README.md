# Random Quote Machine

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to my local machine prior to making the CodePen for it.

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ). The app must fulfill these [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) and get all tests to pass.
